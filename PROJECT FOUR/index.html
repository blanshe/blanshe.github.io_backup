      <p class="body-text serif">I went for Africa’s iron-fist strong men—I mean men who became presidents before you were born. It maybe even before your father started dating you mum.</p>
      <p class="body-text serif">I picked eight Africa’s longest serving presidents who came to power between 1975 and 2000. They have ruled Africa for a combined 246yrs.</p>
      <p class="body-text serif">Cameroon’s Paul is the longest serving head of state. And he has been in power for 44yrs. I mean from 1975 up to now and he is still going. Republic of Congo’s Denis Sassou Nguesso first served from 1979 to 1992 and was defeated in the country’s (arguably) first free and fair election. He went to the bush and recaptured power again in 1999.</p>
      <p class="body-text serif">But why did I do this? I looked at a few visuals of Africa’s strong men published before and thought I could do something better. one of them is <a href="https://qz.com/africa/1255609/africas-longest-serving-presidents-in-uganda-cameroon-equatorial-guinea-others-are-addicted-to-power/">here</a> published by Quartz Africa in 2018. And there are many more.</p>

        <p class="chart-subhead"> I creaded horizontal bar graphs in pandas and much of the work was done in illustrator.</p>

      <h3 class="section-head serif">They are the best</h3>
      <p class="body-text serif">The iron-fist long serving presidents have earned Africa excess notoriety. Nevertheless, there are also many, many good presidents in Africa. They ruled and went quietly. And some are still serving their terms now. But I just picked five of those who have been considered Africa’s best presidents.</p>
      <p class="body-text serif">They are; South Africa’s Nelson Mandela, Tanzania’s Julius Nyerere, Ghana’s Kwame Nkurumah, Ehtiopia’s emperor Haile Selassie and Burkina Faso’s Thomas Sankara. They were in power for a varying period. Thomas Sankara ruled for 4 years and Haile Selassie 44 years.</p>
