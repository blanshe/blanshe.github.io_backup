      <p class="body-text serif">Unsurprisingly. United States was the unrivalled exporter of firearms in 2017 and 2018 respectively. United States exported firearms valued at $12.4 billion in 2017, but 2018 exports went down to $10.5 billion.</p>
      <p class="body-text serif">Russia is placed second both in 2017 and 2018. It sold firearms valued at $5,741 million in 2017. This figure increased to $6,409 million in 2018. Russia is followed by France, Germany and Israel respectively in the top five-fold.</p>

      <h3 class="section-head serif">Export revenue vs import expenditure</h3>
      <p class="body-text serif">I also analyzed the amount of money in million dollars that countries earned from export or spent on import of firearms. This time I extended my analysis to 20 countries that exported firearms in 2018.</p>
      <p class="body-text serif">The United States once again stands up. It earns a lot of million dollars from exports and spends a tiny percent of this revenue on import of weapons. Other countries that earned more from export than they spent on import of firearms are Spain, Italy, France, Britain and Israel. See the graph below.</p>
