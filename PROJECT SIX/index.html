    <div class="story-body">
      <p class="body-text serif">The U.S. birth rate is now at its lowest point in 30 years, according to National Vital Statistics Rapid Release report.  Vast media reports focused on what will be the likely impacts of this rate but I focus on how birth rate has been falling among racial groups. You can find the data set <a href="https://cdc.gov/nchs/data/nvsr/nvsr66/nvsr66_01.pdf">here</a></p>
      <p class="body-text serif">The birth rate has been falling among all race groups, but far more among American-Indian-Alaska natives. They had the highest rate in 1980 but by 2015, they had the lowest birth rate.</p>

      <h3 class="section-head serif">Fertility Rate</h3>
      <p class="body-text serif">This means, fertility rate, a key determinant of birth rate has also been scaling down. Once again, fertility rate has been on the downward trend but far more among American-Indian-Alaska natives than other race groups.</p>

      <div class="chart-section">
      <p class="chart-title">Fertility rate from 1980-2015</p>
      <p class="chart-subhead">This graph show fertility rate trend.</p>
      <div class="chart-row">
        <div class="chart">
          <img src="images/fertility-rate-01.png"/>
        </div>
      </div>
      <p class="chart-source">Sources: Center for Disease Control and Prevention </p>
    </div>
    <p class="body-text serif">Demographers Christine Percheski and Sarah Cannon in a 2012 paper argued that falling among American-Indian-Alaska could be explained by time to time variation of Americans who identify themselves with this racial group.</p>
    <p class="body-text serif">“A high proportion of individuals who identify as AI/AN at one point in time change racial identification between census years; fewer than one-third of people who included an AI/AN identification in 2000 or 2010 had the same race and ethnicity responses in both of those censuses. It is possible that changes in the composition of the self-identified AI/AN population are related to changes in fertility,” they argued.</p>
    <p class="body-text serif">They also argued that there may be a real change in fertility among American Indians. “The AI/AN population had relatively high fertility for decades and a decline could signify a shift toward convergence with the fertility patterns of other racial and ethnic groups. Alternatively, a sharp decline in period fertility could reflect changes in fertility timing or marriage behavior across cohorts, possibly because of changes in educational attainment, economic circumstances, or migration from rural areas (including reservations) to cities.”</p>



    <h3 class="section-head serif">Born to unmarried women</h3>
    <p class="body-text serif">I looked at the percent of babies born to unmarried mothers in U.S states in 2017 and mapped it. You can find data <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/pressroom/sosmap/unmarried/unmarried.htm">here</a></p></p>
